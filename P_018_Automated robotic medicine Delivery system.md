# Automated robotic medicine Delivery system
## Abstract
There have been several researches in the field of medical science to develop a system that reduces the dependency on the caretaker and also that reminds patients about their medicines. Here we propose a new system which is capable of delivering medicines in hospital rooms from the pharmacy directly in accordance with prescription of doctors, Here in this project we have a robotic vehicle capable of moving and this vehicle can deliver medicine’s to patients at there rooms on time as prescribed by the doctor.at the pharmacy they load medicine’s in the robotic vehicle and they select rooms to deliver the medicine’s after loading the medicine’s the robotic vehicle moves and it will deliver the pills in the room.

Now a days there are a lots risks in visiting patients even if they are medical officers so with the help of this project we can avoid the regular visit of nurse and other attenders so we can reduce the risk of spreading diseases like covid19 in patients in different rooms
