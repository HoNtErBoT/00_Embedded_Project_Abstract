# IoT Based Car Black Box
## Abstract
In South-East Asian cities such as Delhi, Dhaka road accidents are a very common occurrence which brings disaster to human lives as well as infrastructures. Sometimes people cannot reach hospitals prompt after an accident because of no one helps them, deficit of ambulance, lack of a mechanism to timely propagate information to the appropriate authority. To ensure the safety of lives, this project proposes an automated IoT based effective accident detection system. Immediately after an incident, the data information is sent to the webserver, instant notification is forwarded to the victimâ€™s acquaintances and also to the relevant authorities such as traffic control room, police station, ambulance service. When an accident occurs the details are updated to police fire force ambulance and the RC-owner of the vehicle.

Use of the proposed IOT based system gathers the vehicle information and immediately passed to nearest help centre. This process saves the life of many people injured in accidents. The suggested IOT based system detects the accident and sends the information to nearby first aid centre in less time.
