# Implementation of the Precision Agriculture Using LEACH Protocol of WSN
## Abstract:
The evolution of wireless sensor network technology leads to develop advanced systems for real-time monitoring. Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a major technology that drives the development of precision agriculture. By forming wireless sensor network, agricultural practices can be made good monitoring systems. Various agricultural parameters like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity are monitored by monitoring units. The paper explains about how to utilize the sensors in agricultural practices and explains about routing protocols of wireless sensor network. In this paper, agricultural parameter of temperature will monitor with the use of LEACH protocol.
## DESCRIPTION
Precision Agriculture is a farming management concept based on observing, measuring and responding to inter field variability of crops. Precision agriculture refers to the use of information and control technologies in agriculture. Effective soil data collection and processing is a key requirement in this application to use the resources effectively for maximizing the crop yield and minimizing the impact on the environment. In this paper a sensor network for such a precision agriculture application is described. WSN technologies have become a backbone for modern precision agriculture monitoring. A wireless sensor network typically consists of a large number of low-cost sensor devices with limited battery energy deployed in an unattended manner. Routing and data dissemination are an important issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The essential function of a WSN is to monitor a phenomenon in a physical environment and report sensed data to a base station, where additional operations can be applied to the gathered data. Real time data was collected by wireless sensor nodes and transmitted to the base station using RF signal. Data was received, saved and displayed at base station to achieve soil temperature, soil moisture and humidity monitoring. The data was continuously monitored at base station and if it exceeds the desired limit, a message was sent to farmer mobile for controlling actions
## TECHNOLOGY
Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is the first hierarchical cluster-based routing protocol for wireless sensor network .In LEACH the nodes are partitions into clusters and in each cluster there is a dedicated node with extra privileges called Cluster Head (CH). This CH creates and manipulates a TDMA (Time division multiple access) schedule for the other nodes (cluster member) of that cluster. Those CHs aggregate and compress the sensing data and send to base Station (BS)
