# Smart Blind Walking Stick: AI-Powered Object Detection and Navigation Assistance System

# Abstract:

The "Smart Blind Walking Stick" is an innovative assistive device designed to enhance the mobility and safety of visually impaired individuals. Leveraging the power of AI computer vision, embedded systems, and IoT technology, this project aims to provide real-time object detection and navigation assistance to blind individuals.

The core components of this system include an ESP32CAM module with a camera positioned at the front of the walking stick. The camera captures images of the environment in front of the user, and these images are processed using the YOLO  object detection algorithm. When the user moves with the walking stick, the camera continuously captures images and analyzes them for potential obstacles or objects.

In the event of an obstacle or object detection, the system responds by activating a vibration motor integrated into the handle of the walking stick. This tactile feedback provides immediate notification to the user, helping them navigate safely around obstacles. Moreover, the system offers an additional layer of interaction through a button on the walking stick. When pressed, this button triggers a Bluetooth headset to convey auditory information about the detected object, which is simultaneously displayed on a mobile app on the user's smartphone.

This project combines cutting-edge AI technologies, embedded systems, and IoT connectivity to empower visually impaired individuals with real-time information about their surroundings. By enhancing their situational awareness and offering both tactile and auditory feedback, the "Smart Blind Walking Stick" aims to improve the independence and safety of blind individuals as they navigate the world around them.
