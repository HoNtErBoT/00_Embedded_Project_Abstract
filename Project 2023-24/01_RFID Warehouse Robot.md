# RFID Warehouse Robot
### Abstract
The main aim of this project is to build an autonomous robot which identifies and picks the household items and store the item in appropriate location.
The purpose of this project is to use robot which has the ability to identify the items by reading the tag on the items. The robot should load up the item and navigate to prescribed destination using line follower module to store the item at the appropriate place and location.
# DESCRIPTION:
RFID is one of the latest trend in the industry. Its potential application can range from warehouse to library management. This project is aimed to build an autonomous robot with RFID application. The project integrates RFID reader and microcontroller as the main components. The movement control comprises motor with infrared sensors for the line follower.
The whole programming operation was carried out by embedded c language. The robot has the ability to identify the items by reading the tag on the items. The robot will pick up the item and navigate to prescribed destination using line follower module to store the item at the appropriate place and location. A small white platform with black line is built for demonstration and testing
# TECHNOLOGY:
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a silicon chip-based transponder that communicates via radio waves. Radio Frequency Identification is a technology which uses tags as a component in an integrated supply chain solution set that will evolve over the next several years. RFID tags contain a chip which holds an electronic product code (EPC) number that points to additional data detailing the contents of the package.
Readers identify the EPC numbers at a distance, without line-of-sight scanning or involving physical contact. Middleware can perform initial filtering on data from the readers. Applications are evolving to comply with shipping products to automatically processing transactions based on RFID technology.
The Identification of authorized persons is stored in the RFID module. when ever we want to perform a task the authorized person keeps the RFID Tag on the RFID Reader it reads the and checks whether it is a VALID or INVALID card, if the card belongs to the authorized person (if it is a valid one) then it will allow for further operations i.e., it will send the information to the controller and controller will reads the data.
The data is received from particular reader, based on the technology used and is compared with pre-stored values. The device is accessible or the task is performed if and only if the received data equals pre-stored data (Authentication Success).
Else it prompts that the Authentication Failure is occurred and LCD displays the message that the concern person is an authorized person or not. If the person is an unauthorized person then he can't perform the task. If he is an authorized person he can perform the task as specified in program
This project implements the robot which will pick up the item and navigate to prescribe destination and to store the item at the appropriate place and location with RFID application.
