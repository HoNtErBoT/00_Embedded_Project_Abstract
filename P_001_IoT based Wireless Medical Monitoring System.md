# ABSTRACT

The main aim of this project is to monitor a patient's vitals, and it can detect the patient's real-time body temperature, heart rate, and other physiological information and transmit it to the control center.

# PURPOSE

Now days the fast development and popularisation of information processing and wireless data transmission technology, the research of wireless Medical Monitoring System has became a hot topic with the help of biomedical sensors. By utilising the wireless technique to transmit information between medical sensors and the monitoring control center, the free space of patients is enlarged, and the efficiency of the modern management of hospitals can be improved.

# DESCRIPTION

Now, with the increase of biomedical sensors, we are going into this process of detecting the patient's real-time body temperature, heart rate, and other physiological information. The design of the wireless monitoring terminal and the development of the system software are the two main components of a wireless medical monitoring system.The monitoring terminal generally consists of three modules: the sensor module, the control module, and the wireless communication module.

The sensor module is used for acquiring medical information from the outside and then converting it to digital signals. The control module is often compared to the brain of the monitoring terminal, which is in charge of coordinating the tasks of different modules, controlling the sensors, processing data, and executing communication protocols.

The wireless communication module mainly deals with the wireless transmission of information. Nowadays, there are various kinds of wireless communication protocols. But since the main task of a monitoring terminal is to realise the transmission of signals such as heart rate, body temperature, and calling signals, the data traffic is not heavy.

Moreover, because the monitoring terminal is worn by patients and needs to be powered by batteries, it puts a high demand on the wireless transmission module's ability to reduce its power dissipation. Having taken these comprehensive factors into consideration, this paper chooses WiFi as the wireless communication protocol. This allows us to connect our system to a cloud storage service and access data from anywhere in the world.Â
