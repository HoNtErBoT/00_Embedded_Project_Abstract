# Dam Automation using IoT(Internet of Things)

### ABSTRACT

Dams play a very important role in holding and conserving water for optimal usage based on seasonal needs. Water management plays a very important role in mitigating the current issues of water distribution and utilization. There are a lot of hazards related to the existence of the dams. It has become a necessity to develop a proper monitoring system. system regarding the opening of the dam gate to retain a safe The level of water in dams Investigating the use of IoT for improving dam safety, water flow, and dam gate corrosion prevention. This paper intends to use a microcontroller for monitoring and controlling the water distribution management through the use of various sensors, control valves, and actuators to proactively and automatically manage outflow during crises using statistical data about the environment.

### PURPOSE

Nowadays, water management is an issue of growing concern as there is limited availability of consumable water. Owing to unforeseen weather conditions such as heavy rainfall, sudden changes in tides, and other natural forces, there are natural calamities that cause problems like an increase in the mortality rate, contamination of consumable water, and agricultural problems that may negatively impact the economy of the country. The construction of dams provides future water bodies, protects the available water from pollution, and prevents disputes and overexploitation. Therefore, dams play a significant role in water management.
Even today, we have been using traditional methods for managing and monitoring the dam gates and measuring the level of water and other parameters. Many factors contribute towards
failure of a dam, the most common being overtopping, which is caused by heavy floods. This condition needs constant monitoring to avoid catastrophes such as dam failure, which is not To overcome dam failure and ensure continuous monitoring of dam health, the enabling technology of the Internet of Things (IoT) is used. Through this, the authorities have continuous access to data about the dam's health and can take appropriate decisions.
Many systems were available for monitoring dams. Among the notable ones related to our research, we are paying attention to the development of autonomous dam gate systems using level sensors and motor controllers. Although the dam gates are automatically controlled using a DC motor,
