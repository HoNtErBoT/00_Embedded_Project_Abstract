# Dam Automation using IoT(Internet of Things)

### ABSTRACT

Dams play a very important role in holding and conserving water for optimal usage based on seasonal needs. Water management plays a very important role in mitigatingÂ the current issues of water distribution and utilization. There are a lot of hazards related to the existence of the dams. It has become a necessity to develop a proper monitoring system. system regarding the opening of the dam gate to retain a safe The level of water in dams Investigating the use of IoT for improving dam safety, water flow, and dam gate corrosion prevention. This paper intends to use a microcontroller for monitoring and controlling the water distribution management through the use of various sensors, control valves, and actuators to proactively and automatically manage outflow during crises using statistical data about the environment.
