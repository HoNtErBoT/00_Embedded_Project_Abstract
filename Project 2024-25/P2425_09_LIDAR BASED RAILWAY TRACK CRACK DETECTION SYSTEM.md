# LIDAR-Based Railway Track Crack Detection System

Railway track integrity is critical for the safe and efficient operation of rail transport systems, as undetected track cracks can lead to catastrophic derailments and significant financial losses. This project presents an innovative and cost-effective model for early detection of micro-cracks in railway tracks using the VL53L0X Lidar sensor, integrated with an ESP32 microcontroller.

The system is designed around a scaled-down railway track and a mobile inspection vehicle equipped with advanced sensors. The VL53L0X Lidar sensor enables high-precision distance measurements, continuously scanning for variations in surface elevation or unexpected gaps indicative of micro-cracks. When a crack is detected, the vehicle halts immediately, using pre-programmed algorithms on the ESP32 to assess the anomaly.

To enhance the system's capabilities, a GPS module has been integrated to obtain the exact location of the detected cracks, enabling precise geotagging for maintenance teams. Additionally, an SR04 ultrasonic sensor is included to detect obstacles in front of the vehicle, ensuring emergency braking in real-time and preventing further damage or accidents.

Once a crack or obstacle is identified, the system sends an automatic alert to a remote server over Wi-Fi, providing real-time data on the crack’s location and severity. This cloud-based monitoring platform enables remote assessment and facilitates predictive maintenance actions, minimizing inspection delays and human intervention.

By leveraging the ESP32’s advanced capabilities, the system demonstrates seamless integration with cloud platforms, efficient data transmission, and robust real-time performance. This project emphasizes a proactive approach to railway maintenance, offering enhanced precision and reliability. The design aims to simulate a scalable and practical solution for full-scale railway applications, revolutionizing traditional inspection methods by increasing safety and operational efficiency worldwide.
