# IoT based Air Pollution Monitoring System

Air pollution is a growing concern worldwide, necessitating efficient and cost-effective solutions to monitor and mitigate its impact. This project presents a real-time air pollution monitoring system leveraging the ESP32 microcontroller and an array of sensors, including the MQ135 for detecting air quality, the MQ2 for detecting flammable gases, and the DHT11 for measuring temperature and humidity.
The system is designed to provide accurate environmental data and real-time alerts. The sensors continuously monitor key parameters such as air quality, gas concentrations, and atmospheric conditions. When pollution levels exceed predefined thresholds, the system triggers an audible alarm using a buzzer and displays the current status on an LCD screen, ensuring immediate local awareness.
The ESP32, with its inbuilt Wi-Fi capabilities, facilitates the transmission of real-time data to a cloud platform, enabling remote monitoring and historical data analysis. This integration allows users to access live updates and trends via a web or mobile interface, empowering them to take timely actions.
This project provides a scalable and efficient solution for air quality monitoring, making it ideal for urban and industrial areas. By leveraging IoT technology, the system offers an affordable and reliable method to promote environmental awareness and support pollution control initiatives.
