# Child Monitoring System Using GPS and IoT
This project presents an IoT-based Child Monitoring System designed to enhance child safety
through real-time location and health monitoring. Utilizing the Neo-6M GPS module and ESP8266
NodeMCU, the system captures precise latitude and longitude coordinates of the child’s location.
Additionally, it incorporates temperature and BPM/SpO2 sensors to monitor vital signs, including
body temperature, heart rate, and blood oxygen levels. These location and health data are uploaded
to Firebase, a cloud-based platform, for centralized storage and management. Firebase serves as the
primary controller for processing location and health data, triggering alerts, and integrating with
potential secondary systems, such as mobile applications or web dashboards. The result is a
comprehensive, streamlined solution for monitoring children’s movements and health, offering
caregivers a reliable tool for ensuring both safety and well-being, and providing peace of mind in
real-time.
