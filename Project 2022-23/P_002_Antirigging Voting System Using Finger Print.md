# Antirigging Voting System Using Finger Print

### ABSTRACT
The aim of this project is to implement the development of an anti-rigging voting system using finger prints. The project's goal is to provide a safe and dependable environment for customers while they vote for candidates using an intelligent electronic voting machine that assigns a unique identity to each user using fingerprint identification technology. 

### DESCRIPTION

We will provide the highest level of security in this project because the EVM will be authenticated using finger prints.Intelligent EVM is an embedded-based project. It involves microcontrollers and interfaces.

Intelligent EVM has been specially designed to collect, record, store, count, and display 100 percent accurately. It has two units: the control unit and the ballot unit. It has a "Display" section that will display the number of votes for each candidate at the end of the poll.

The ballet unit has a keypad where the user can select any of them. And at the next trail, the same user is being avoided to prevent him from tampering. The control unit is entirely designed by a microcontroller, and it has the ability to increase the number of electing members. So whenever we want to access the finger print scanner, first we have to press the switch.

The scanner is interfaced to the microcontroller with serial interfacing. The microcontroller reads the data from the scanner. The microcontroller allows those users who are authorised to vote. If an unauthorised user attempts to access the account, the microcontroller activates the security alarm.Now the microcontroller gets the information, and the result is indicated or displayed on the LCD.

The ballet unit is a simple keypad interfaced to the control unit and has labelling on it to identify the respective candidate. A microcontroller designs the control unit. Since it has internal flash, the data can be recorded internally and then processed further.
