# Driver Behaviour Intelligence (DBI) System
## Abstract
In this system we place a set of sensors in the seat and the steering to find the siting posture and steering wheel movement, Based on the above sensor reading our micro controller unit will estimate the driver behaviour is fit for a safe ride, if there is any Driver Behaviour problems our sensors will accurately detect the scenario and provide necessary warning to the driver through an alert sound and an LCD Display.<br><br>
Here in this system we are using a Potentiometer to detect the steering position and we use  a set of force sensors to estimate the sating posture of the driver
